# Dev2 - Site Management Scripts

These are the scripts that work the magic for managing sites on Dev2.

If you have an older copy of the Dev2 prior to Jan 6th, 2016 you need to follow these instructions:

1. Change to your home directory scripts folder:  
    `cd ~/scripts`  
2. Remove all files in the "~/scripts" folder:  
    `rm fix-permissions.sh make-site.sh prep-site.sh`
3. Clone the scripts repo into the "~/scripts" folder:  
    `git clone https://github.com/ejanus/dev2-scripts.git .`

done!
